    "Also called the red city, Marrakech is the fourth largest city in the Kingdom after Casablanca, Fez, and Tangier with more than one million inhabitants, it remains the tourist capital of the country with its countless markets, gardens, museums, palaces, and mosques. For the tourists, finding the optimal location taking into consideration the preferred type of dish and distance is a challenge. This gives an incentive to build a tool of recommendation for the best restaurant venues based on their taste.\n",

    "To carry out this project, I will need two data sets. First, I will use Foursquare API to retrieve location data about the restaurants in the city of Marrakech. For each restaurant, information retrieved includes the restaurant name, ID, location and category of food. As an illustration, here is a list of restaurants for romantic dinner in Marrakech: https://fr.foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&ne=31.695164%2C-7.906551&q=D%C3%AEner%20en%20amoureux&sw=31.547819 % 2C-8.106365.\n",
