To carry out this project, I will need two data sets. First, I will use Foursquare API to retrieve location data about the restaurants in the city of Marrakech. For each restaurant, information retrieved includes the restaurant name, ID, location and category of food. As an illustration, here is a list of restaurants for romantic dinner in Marrakech: https://fr.foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&ne=31.695164%2C-7.906551&q=D%C3%AEner%20en%20amoureux&sw=31.547819 % 2C-8.106365

Second, I will use the geo-coordinates of the borough of Marrakech with the help of both the geocoder tool, that serve to find the geo-coordinate of a location, and the list of borough from Wikipedia: https: //fr.wikipedia .org / wiki / Cat% C3% A9gorie: Arrondissement_de_Marrakech
